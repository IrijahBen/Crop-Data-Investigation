# Canada Crop Production Analysis

## Project Overview
As a newly hired data scientist at a US Venture Capital firm, your first task is to conduct a high-level analysis of crop production in Canada. The company is exploring foreign grain markets to support its supply chain needs for recent investments in the microbrewery and microdistillery industry, which focuses on craft beer and spirits production.

Your stakeholders are interested in understanding the historical and current performance of specific crop types in terms of supply and price. They seek a macroeconomic perspective on Canada's crop farming industry and its relation to the relative value of the Canadian and US dollars.

## Datasets
The analysis requires working with four key datasets:
1. **Annual Crop Data**: Contains yearly crop production figures in Canada.

2. **Farm Product Prices**: Provides monthly pricing data for farm products.

3. **Daily Foreign Exchange (FX) Data**: Tracks daily exchange rates between the Canadian and US dollars.

## Objectives
- Analyze trends in crop production volume over time.
- Examine variations in farm product prices.
- Investigate the impact of currency exchange fluctuations on agricultural trade.
- Identify insights that inform investment strategies in foreign grain markets.

## Steps to Get Started
1. Download and inspect the datasets.
2. Clean and preprocess the data for analysis.
3. Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and trends.
4. Visualize key findings using statistical and graphical techniques.
5. Interpret insights to guide investment decision-making.

## Expected Deliverables
- A comprehensive report summarizing crop production trends.
- Insights into farm product pricing and exchange rate impact.
- Data visualizations highlighting key findings.
